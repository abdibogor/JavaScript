	DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
- The DOM Is an 'application programming interface'
- Use the DOM when we interact with web pages

- Add content to a HTML document
- Delete content from a HTML document

DOCUMENT
- The document is just the web page

	Objects Are Elements

Every HTML element in the document is an object:

- <head></head> is an object
- <body></body> is an object
- <ul></ul> is an object
- <p></p> is an object


NODES 
- Everything we can change in the document is a node:
- Elements
- Text within elements
- HTML attributes

What Can We Do with The DOM?
- change the <h1> text node at the top of the page
- change the background colour of an element node
- Animate the logo node from left to right
- Expand(développer) the height of an element node when you click on it.
