	<!--
		Including External JS files
. As with inline Javascript code, processing of the page is halted("arrÃªter") while the external file is interpreted.
. In XHTML documents, you can omit the closing tag, as in this example:
<script type="text/javascript" src="example.js">
	.This syntax should not be used in HTML documents, because it is invalid HTML and won't be handled properly by some browsers, like internet explorer.

		 Including External JS Files
. It's important to note that a <script> element using the src attribute should not include additional JavaScript code between the <script> and </script> tags.
. if both are provided, the script file is downloaded and executed while the inline code is ignored.

 	External JS from a different website
 . Ability to include JavaScript files from outside domains.
 . Much like an <img> element, the <script> element's src attribute may be set to a full URL that exists outside the domain on which the HTML page exists, as in this example

 	<script type="text/javascript" src="http:www.somewhere.com/afile.js"></script>

 		External JS files from a different website
 . Code from an external domain will be loaded and interpreted as if it were part of the page that is loading it.
 . This capability allows you to server up Javascript from various domains if necessary.
 . Be careful,however, if you are referencing Javascript files located on a server that you don't control.
 . A malicious programmer could, at any time, replace the file.
  . The <script> elements are interpreted in the order in which they appear in the page so long as the defer and async attributes are not present.
  	. the first <script> element's code must be completely interpreted before the second <script> element begins interpretation the second must be completed before the third,  and so on.
