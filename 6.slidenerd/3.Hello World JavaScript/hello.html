<h1>Hello From Slidenerd and Vivz, and JS</h1>

	<!-- 
	A small issue with writing </script>
	.When using inline JavaScript code, keep in mind that you cannot have the string "</script>" anywhere in your code.
    . Because of the way that inline scripts are parsed, the browser sees the string "</string>" as if it were the closing </script> tag:
    . Use / character to make it acceptable to browsers so that they won't cause any errors.
