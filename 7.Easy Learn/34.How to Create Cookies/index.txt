How do you set and update JavaScript cookies? The way to create a new cookie in JavaScript is really easy. Simply assign a string to the cookie property of the document object (document.cookie), formated in a key=value fashion.

points:
- cookies are associated with the document object (more on it later)
- cookies are shared across the entire application (domain)
   
- if you use a name for a cookie that's already in use, the previous value will be overridden
