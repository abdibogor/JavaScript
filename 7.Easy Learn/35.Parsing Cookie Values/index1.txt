How do you read JavaScript cookies? The way to get the value of an existing cookie in JavaScript is really easy. 
Simply read the cookie property of the global document object. 
Since all cookie key-value pairs are contained in the same string, you will need to parse the string manually in order to get a specific cookie value.

key points:
  
 - all cookie values are strings
   
- string needs to be parsed by hand, or you can use existing JS libraries
   
- string.split is handy for this (more on String functions later)
